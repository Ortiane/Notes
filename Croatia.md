- **Chicago (ORD)**: Strong hub connections through Munich, Frankfurt, Vienna, and Warsaw [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/flights/route/to-country/us/hr.html)  
- **Washington DC (IAD)**: Austrian Airlines' Vienna hub provides smooth connections [My Global Viewpoint](https://www.myglobalviewpoint.com/best-airlines-to-fly-to-croatia/)
- **Los Angeles (LAX)**: Best West Coast option via European hubs [My Global Viewpoint](https://www.myglobalviewpoint.com/best-airlines-to-fly-to-croatia/)

Major carriers include Lufthansa ($900-1,300 RT), Austrian Airlines ($850-1,250 RT), and SWISS ($900-1,300 RT). United offers premium-priced seasonal directs from Newark to Dubrovnik ($1,100-1,500 RT).

### Days 1-2: Zagreb (2 nights) 
**Hotel:** The Westin Zagreb (Marriott) - 15,000-20,000 points/night

Arrive at Zagreb Airport and take the Pleso shuttle bus to the city center (€8, 35 minutes). [Cruise Croatia +5](https://cruisecroatia.com/blog/is-croatia-expensive/) Croatia's capital offers the perfect jet-lag recovery with its manageable size and excellent tram system.

**Day 1 activities:** After settling in, explore the Upper Town (Gornji Grad) with its medieval St. Mark's Church featuring the iconic mosaic-tiled roof. Wander down to the Lower Town and Tkalčićeva Street, Zagreb's pedestrian restaurant row. Browse Dolac Market, the vibrant open-air farmer's market. [Free Tour Europe](https://freetoureurope.com/en/free-walking-tour-zagreb/)

**Day 2 activities:** Visit the Museum of Broken Relationships (€10/person), explore the Zagreb 80's Museum or Museum of Illusions (€12/person), and stroll through Maksimir Park. Take a free walking tour (tip €15-20/person) [Free Tour Europe](https://freetoureurope.com/en/free-walking-tour-zagreb/) to understand the city's Austro-Hungarian architecture and Yugoslav history.

Breakfast at Otto & Frank on Tkalčićeva (€10-12), lunch at Kantun Paulina (€15-20), dinner at Stara Sava for massive portions of traditional Croatian food (€25-35/person with wine). [One Way Ticket](https://www.onewaytkt.com/blog/zagreb-food)

- Food (2 days): €380

### Days 3-4: Plitvice Lakes National Park (2 nights)

Croatia's most famous natural wonder deserves two nights for proper exploration. [Nacionalni Park Plitvička Jezera](https://np-plitvicka-jezera.hr/en/plitvice-lakes-national-park/) Stay near Entrance 1 or Entrance 2 to access the park when gates open at 7am—critical for avoiding summer crowds.

**Day 3:** Arrive midday, settle into accommodation, take afternoon stroll around park entrance area. Have dinner at Lička kuća restaurant for traditional Lika region cuisine (€25-35/person).

**Day 4:** Enter park at 7am opening. Follow Route H or C for the comprehensive 4-6 hour experience covering both Upper and Lower Lakes. The electric boat and panoramic train are included in your ticket. [np-plitvicka-jezera](https://np-plitvicka-jezera.hr/en/plan-your-visit/istrazite-jezera/price-list/) [Plitvicelakesfromsplit](https://www.plitvicelakesfromsplit.com/portfolio/transfer-split-zagreb-with-plitvice-lakes-tour/) Pack a picnic lunch as park restaurants are overpriced and underwhelming.

**Plitvice tips:** Purchase timed-entry tickets online in advance at np-plitvicka-jezera.hr. Peak season entry (June-September) costs €40/person. [np-plitvicka-jezera +2](https://np-plitvicka-jezera.hr/en/plan-your-visit/istrazite-jezera/price-list/) Wear comfortable waterproof shoes as boardwalks get slippery from waterfall spray. Bring layers—mornings are cool even in summer.

**Transportation to next destination:** Afternoon bus to Split (3.5-4 hours, €15/person). [IamTourist](https://iamtourist.org/prices-in-croatia/) [The World Was Here First](https://www.theworldwasherefirst.com/plitvice-lakes-day-trip-from-split-zagreb/) Multiple daily departures.

**Day 5:** Arrive afternoon, check into your sky-high accommodation. Explore Diocletian's Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage site where locals actually live and work within 1,700-year-old Roman walls. [Diocletianspalacetickets](https://www.diocletianspalacetickets.com/) Walk the Riva waterfront promenade, climb Marjan Hill for sunset views. Join a free walking tour (tip €15-20/person) or pay for a guided tour (€25-30/person).

**Day 6: Day trip to Krka National Park.** Take the morning bus to Skradin (1-1.5 hours, €8/person each way). [IamTourist](https://iamtourist.org/prices-in-croatia/) [Visit Croatia](https://www.visit-croatia.co.uk/getting-to-krka-national-park/) The boat from Skradin to Skradinski Buk waterfalls is included in your €40/person park entry. [Taylor On A Trip](https://tayloronatrip.com/what-to-expect-krka-national-park-croatia) Unlike Plitvice, you can swim below Krka's waterfalls. Return to Split by evening bus.

**Day 7:** Explore Split further—visit the Cathedral Bell Tower (€8), wander the cellar passages (€8), or take a day trip to nearby Trogir (30-minute bus, €3) or the island of Brač for Zlatni Rat beach. Alternatively, prepare for your island adventure by relaxing at Bačvice beach.

The sunniest spot in Croatia delivers lavender fields, Venetian architecture, and crystalline waters. Hvar Town pulses with energy while Stari Grad offers quieter authenticity.

**Day 8:** Arrive via catamaran to Hvar Town or Stari Grad. [Ferry Croatia](https://www.ferrycroatia.com/en/krilo/) If arriving in Stari Grad, take the local bus to Hvar Town (30 minutes, €4). Settle into accommodation, explore Hvar Town's marble streets, climb to Spanish Fortress for sunset (€7/person), dine at Dalmatino restaurant (€25-45 mains, complimentary rakija).

**Day 9: Blue Cave tour.** This full-day boat excursion ($90-130/person) visits the ethereal Blue Cave on Biševo Island where sunlight creates an otherworldly blue glow, plus the Green Cave, Stiniva Beach on Vis, and swimming stops at remote coves. [IamTourist](https://iamtourist.org/prices-in-croatia/) Blue Cave entrance adds €24/person in peak season. Book with local operators on Hvar's waterfront or through your hotel.

**Day 10:** Rent a scooter or take a boat tour to the Pakleni Islands (€50-80/person for group tour, or €200-450 for private speedboat). [www.visit-hvar.com](https://www.visit-hvar.com/tours/boat-excursion-pakleni-islands/HV-TR-139) These car-free islets offer hidden beaches and beach clubs.

**Hvar dining:** Coffee and pastries (€5-6), lunch at Fig restaurant for Australian-Californian fusion (€20-30), dinner at Black Pepper for creative Mediterranean (€30-45/person with wine). [Bronwyn Townsend](https://www.bronwyntownsend.com/blog/best-restaurants-hvar-croatia) Hvar prices match Dubrovnik's—this is Croatia's luxury island.

**Transportation to next destination:** Ferry or catamaran to Dubrovnik. Options include the scenic catamaran via Korčula (4.5 hours, €48/person, summer only) or ferry back to Split then bus to Dubrovnik (full day journey). Book carefully as schedules vary.

**Costs for Hvar (2 people):**

### Days 11-13: Dubrovnik (3 nights)
**Hotel:** Hilton Imperial Dubrovnik - 25,000-70,000 points/night (season dependent)

The "Pearl of the Adriatic" deserves its reputation despite cruise-ship crowds. The Hilton Imperial sits at Pile Gate steps from Old Town—Croatia's best points-hotel location. [Head for Points](https://www.headforpoints.com/2020/06/03/review-hilton-imperial-dubrovnik-hotel/) [U.S. News & World Report](https://travel.usnews.com/Hotels/review-Hilton_Imperial_Dubrovnik-Dubrovnik-Croatia-132579/) Summer redemptions cost 70,000 Hilton points but deliver exceptional value for €660+ cash rates.

**Day 11:** Arrive morning or early afternoon. Check into the Hilton Imperial, strategically positioned to beat cruise passengers into Old Town. Walk the City Walls immediately if energy permits—the 1.2-mile circuit takes 1.5-2 hours and costs €35/person (high season). [Inspired by Croatia](https://www.inspiredbycroatia.com/blog/is-dubrovnik-expensive/) [Chasing the Donkey](https://www.chasingthedonkey.com/walking-walls-of-dubrovnik-city-walls/) Go early morning (7-9am) or late afternoon (4-6pm) to avoid midday heat and crowds. Explore Stradun (main street), have dinner outside Old Town in Lapad or Gruž for 20-30% savings.

**Day 12: Day trip to Mljet National Park.** Take the 8am TP Line catamaran to Pomena or Polače (1.5 hours, €20-27/person one-way). [Ferryhopper](https://www.ferryhopper.com/en/blog/ferry-news/tp-line-croatia-ferry-schedules-2024) [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Dubrovnik/Mljet-National-Park) The €25/person park entry includes a boat to St. Mary Island's 12th-century monastery. [Ferryhopper](https://www.ferryhopper.com/en/blog/ferry-news/tp-line-croatia-ferry-schedules-2024) [Traveling](https://traveling.com/en/blog/bus-national-park-mljet/) Rent bikes (€10/person) to circle the emerald saltwater lakes, swim in the warmer Malo Jezero (Small Lake), and lunch at konobas in Polače. Return on the 5pm catamaran to Dubrovnik. Total ferry cost: €54/person roundtrip.

**Day 13:** Sleep in, then take the cable car to Mount Srđ (€27/person roundtrip) for panoramic views. Visit Fort Lovrijenac (included with walls ticket), explore the quiet corners of Old Town away from Stradun's crowds, or ferry to Lokrum Island (€15/person) for swimming and peacocks. Consider a Game of Thrones walking tour (€35-50/person) if you're a fan. Your final evening deserves a splurge—dine at Nautika or Restaurant 360° (€80-120/person) or find more modest excellence at Konoba Tabak (€30-40/person).

**Dubrovnik tips:** Cruise ships dock 10am-5pm—time your Old Town visits outside these windows. Early morning (before 9am) offers magical empty streets. The Dubrovnik Card (€35-55) bundles attractions if you're visiting many sites. Carry cash for small purchases as some vendors skip cards.

**Transportation:** Shuttle bus to Dubrovnik Airport (€5/person, 30-40 minutes) times with your departure flight. [Cruise Croatia](https://cruisecroatia.com/blog/is-croatia-expensive/) [Visit Croatia](https://www.visit-croatia.co.uk/croatia-destinations/zagreb/getting-to-and-from-zagreb-airport/)

### Total Nights Needed: 13 Nights

**Points hotels available (8 nights):**
- Zagreb: 2 nights × 17,500 points = 35,000 Marriott points
- Split: 3 nights × 31,000 points = 93,000 Marriott points  
- Dubrovnik: 3 nights × 50,000 points = 150,000 Hilton points (average of 25K-70K range)

**Cash hotels required (5 nights):**
- Plitvice: 2 nights (no points options)
- Hvar: 3 nights (no points options)

### Points Requirements by Program

**OPTION 1: Maximize Marriott**
- Zagreb: Westin Zagreb (15,000-20,000 points/night)
- Split: AC Hotel Split (31,000 points/night) 
- Dubrovnik: Sheraton Dubrovnik Riviera (30,000-40,000 points/night)

**Total Marriott points needed:** 
- Conservative: (17,500 × 2) + (31,000 × 3) + (35,000 × 3) = **233,000 points**
- Peak season: Could reach 280,000 points

**OPTION 2: Split Marriott/Hilton**
- Zagreb: Westin Zagreb (35,000 Marriott points for 2 nights)
- Split: AC Hotel Split (93,000 Marriott points for 3 nights)
- Dubrovnik: Hilton Imperial (150,000 Hilton points for 3 nights, averaging seasonal rates)

**Total: 128,000 Marriott + 150,000 Hilton = 278,000 total points across programs**

**OPTION 3: Add Hyatt for Zadar Option**
If you modify the itinerary to include Zadar instead of or in addition to another destination:
- Hyatt Regency Zadar: 12,000-18,000 points/night (Category 4) [point.me](https://www.point.me/insights/world-of-hyatt-award-chart/)
- 3 nights = 36,000-54,000 Hyatt points
- Exceptional value for a brand-new luxury property

### Best Points Value Analysis

**Exceptional redemptions:**
1. **AC Hotel Split** at 31,000 Marriott points delivers 0.6-1.0 cents per point value (cash rates $200-300)
2. **Hyatt Regency Zadar** at 15,000 points (standard) for a brand-new luxury property
3. **Hilton Imperial Dubrovnik** at 70,000 points during summer (€660+ cash rate) = 0.9+ CPP

**Adequate redemptions:**
- Westin Zagreb at 17,500 points for a solid business hotel
- Sheraton Dubrovnik Riviera at 35,000 points (outside Old Town but beachfront)

### Where Points Hotels Are Weak

**Islands:** Hvar, Korčula, Vis, Brač, and Mljet have zero Marriott/Hyatt/Hilton properties. You'll book boutique hotels, heritage properties, or apartments. Use Booking.com for competitive rates.

**Plitvice area:** No chain hotels exist near Croatia's most-visited park. Local guesthouses and park hotels (Hotel Jezero, Hotel Plitvice) offer the convenience of walking to entrances at dawn.

**Rovinj/Istria:** If you extend to Istria, no points hotels exist in this charming region.

## Destination-by-Destination Hotel Details

### ZAGREB

**Marriott Properties:**
- **The Westin Zagreb** - City center, 17-story tower, 378 rooms. Category 4-5, typically 15,000-20,000 points/night. Premium business hotel near Croatian National Theatre.

- **Hilton Garden Inn Zagreb Radnicka** - Estimated 25,000-45,000 points/night.

**Recommendation:** Westin Zagreb for Marriott loyalists offers best points value. Canopy for Hilton members who value boutique style and breakfast.

### SPLIT

**Marriott Properties:**
- **AC Hotel by Marriott Split** ⭐ TOP PICK - Floors 18-28 of Westgate Tower (Croatia's tallest building), opened 2023. 214 rooms with panoramic Adriatic views, 10-minute walk to Diocletian's Palace. Category 4, **31,000 points/night**. Pool, spa, rooftop bar, modern luxury. Outstanding value.
- **Le Méridien Lav, Split** - Podstrana beach resort 8km south of Split. Full resort with 9 restaurants, spa, private beach. Category 5-6, **44,000-60,000 points/night**. Better value in high season; skip in low season when cash rates drop to €125.

**No Hyatt or Hilton properties in Split.**

**Recommendation:** AC Hotel Split delivers exceptional value and perfect location for 31,000 points. [Upgraded Points](https://upgradedpoints.com/news/ac-hotel-by-marriott-split/) Le Méridien Lav works for resort stays but location is less convenient without a car.

### DUBROVNIK

**Marriott Properties:**
- **Sheraton Dubrovnik Riviera Hotel** - Mlini-Srebreno Bay, 15 minutes from Old Town, beachfront. Category 5, **30,000-40,000 points/night**. [Turning left for less](https://www.turningleftforless.com/sheraton-riviera-dubrovnik-hotel-review/) 239 rooms, pools, spa, family-friendly. [Marriott](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/dbvsi-sheraton-dubrovnik-riviera-hotel/rooms/) Away from crowds but requires transport to Old Town.

**Hyatt Properties:**
- **Hotel Bellevue Dubrovnik** (Mr & Mrs Smith Collection) - Boutique property on cliff just outside Old Town. Dynamic pricing (no fixed category). High-end but unpredictable point costs.

**Hilton Properties:**
- **Hilton Imperial Dubrovnik** ⭐ TOP PICK - At Pile Gate, edge of Old Town, seafront. Historic 1897 building, 147 rooms. Category 8, **25,000-70,000 points/night** (highly seasonal). Off-season: 25,000-40,000 points. Peak summer: 70,000 points for €660+ cash rates = excellent value. Indoor pool, spa, executive lounge. Best location of any points hotel in Croatia.

**Recommendation:** Hilton Imperial Dubrovnik wins for unbeatable location. Use points in summer for maximum value. Sheraton Dubrovnik works for beach/pool focus but less convenient.

### ZADAR (Optional Modification)

**Hyatt Properties:**
- **Hyatt Regency Zadar** ⭐ BEST HYATT VALUE - Brand new (opened 2024-2025), city center waterfront. Category 4: **12,000-18,000 points/night**. 133 rooms, Lavanda Spa with heated pools, modern luxury, walking distance to Old Town. [Hyatt](https://www.hyatt.com/hyatt-regency/en-US/zadrz-hyatt-regency-zadar) Exceptional value for new property at Category 4 pricing.

**Hilton Properties:**
- **Hotel Preko Ugljan Island** (Curio Collection) - On Ugljan Island near Zadar, requires ferry. Dynamic pricing, typically 50,000-100,000 points.

**Recommendation:** If you modify the itinerary to include Zadar (between Plitvice and Split), the Hyatt Regency Zadar offers Croatia's best points value—brand new luxury at mid-tier points cost.

### Visa Requirements

**US Citizens:** No visa required for stays up to 90 days within 180-day period. [Croatia Gems](https://www.croatiagems.com/croatia-info/croatia-travel/usa-to-croatia-flights/) Croatia joined the Schengen Area on January 1, 2023—your 90 days count toward the total Schengen limit if visiting other European countries.

**Requirements:**

- Return ticket or proof of onward travel
- Proof of sufficient funds (rarely checked but technically required)
- Travel insurance recommended but not mandatory

**Croatia uses the Euro (€)** as of January 1, 2023, replacing the Croatian Kuna. [Skippercity +2](https://www.skippercity.com/prices-in-croatia-2025-cost-of-living-travel-food-accommodation-more/)

**Payment landscape:**
- Credit cards widely accepted in hotels, restaurants, larger shops, and transportation
- Visa and Mastercard most accepted; American Express less common
- Contactless payments common in cities
- Cash still king for: small konobas, markets, bus luggage fees, tips, small island shops

**ATM strategy:**
- Withdraw from bank ATMs (avoid touristy kiosks with poor rates)
- Zagrebačka Banka, Privredna Banka, and Erste Bank reliable
- Withdraw larger amounts (€200-300) to minimize fees
- Notify your bank of travel dates to avoid card blocks

**Tipping culture:**
- Not mandatory but appreciated for good service
- Restaurants: Round up or 10% for excellent service

- Withdraw from ATMs rather than exchange booths
- Eat where locals eat (away from main tourist squares)
- Buy picnic supplies at Konzum, Lidl, or Tommy supermarkets [Chasing the Donkey](https://www.chasingthedonkey.com/is-croatia-expensive-to-visit-with-the-euro/)
- Take advantage of daily lunch specials (dnevni meni) for 30-40% savings

## Transportation Without a Car: Why It Works

This entire itinerary runs smoothly on public transport because Croatia's tourism infrastructure accommodates non-drivers exceptionally well along the Dalmatian coast and between major sites.

**Where public transport excels:**
- Zagreb: Excellent tram and bus network makes cars unnecessary
- Plitvice: Direct buses from Zagreb, Split, and Zadar; no parking hassles
- Split: Perfect public transport hub with buses and ferries to everywhere
- Islands: Cars discouraged—narrow streets, expensive ferries, limited parking
- Dubrovnik: Compact Old Town is pedestrian-only; local buses connect districts

**Where a car would add marginal convenience:**
- Exploring inland Istria's hilltop villages (but organized tours available)
- Flexibility for remote beaches (but best beaches accessible by boat or bus)
- Krka National Park alternative entrances (but Skradin entrance works perfectly)

**Public transport advantages:**
- No rental car costs (€30-50/day) or fuel (€1.70/liter)
- No parking fees (€1-3/hour in cities; €15-20/day in Dubrovnik)
- No stress driving unfamiliar narrow roads
- No expensive one-way drop-off fees (€50-150 for Zagreb-Dubrovnik)
- Can enjoy wine at lunch and dinner
- More sustainable and authentic local experience

**Real talk:** A car provides maximum flexibility for off-the-beaten-path exploration and visiting multiple small villages in one day. But for first-time visitors hitting major highlights on this itinerary, public transport delivers 95% of the experience at 50% of the cost and stress.

## Final Recommendations

**Book early for summer travel:** 
- Hotel points bookings: 4-6 months out for July-August
- International flights: 60-90 days out

**Consider travel insurance:**
- Covers trip cancellation, medical emergencies, lost luggage

- Dress modestly when entering churches (covered shoulders and knees)
- Topless sunbathing common at beaches; nude beaches designated
- Smoking still prevalent; outdoor cafe seating often includes smokers
